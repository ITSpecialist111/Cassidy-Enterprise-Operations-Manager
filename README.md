### Setup Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ITSpecialist111/Cassidy-Enterprise-Operations-Manager.git
   cd Cassidy-Enterprise-Operations-Manager
   ```

2. **Configure Azure credentials**

   # Edit a365.config.json with your:
   # - Azure Tenant ID
   # - Subscription ID
   # - Resource Group
   # - App registration details
   ```

3. **Set environment variables**
   ```bash
   cp .env.template .env
   # Edit .env with your:
   # - MicrosoftAppId (blueprint app client ID)
   # - MicrosoftAppPassword (blueprint app secret)
   # - AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT and AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT
   # - OPS_TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID (for standup posts)
   # - MANAGER_EMAIL (for notifications)
   # - SCHEDULED_SECRET (for authenticated API calls)
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

5. **Build locally**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. **Test locally** (if supported)
   ```bash
   npm test
   ```

### Deployment to Azure

#### Using Azure Developer CLI (recommended)

```bash
# Initialize project (if not already done)
azd init

# Deploy to Azure
azd up
```

#### Manual Deployment

1. **Build Docker image** (via `cassidy/Dockerfile`)
   ```bash
   docker build -t cassidy:latest .
   docker tag cassidy:latest <acr-name>.azurecr.io/cassidy:latest
   docker push <acr-name>.azurecr.io/cassidy:latest
   ```

2. **Deploy to Microsoft Foundry**
   ```bash
   # Use a365 CLI or Azure Portal to:
   # 1. Create hosted agent from agent.yaml
   # 2. Configure environment variables
   # 3. Start the agent container
   ```

## Configuration

### agent.yaml
Defines the agent blueprint for Foundry deployment:
- Agent name, description, and metadata
- Required environment variables
- Protocol specifications
- Resource requirements

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Purpose | Example |
|----------|---------|---------|
| `MicrosoftAppId` | Entra app client ID (blueprint) | `151d7bf7-...` |
| `MicrosoftAppPassword` | Entra app secret | `AQAANCMnd8B...` |
| `MicrosoftAppTenantId` | Entra tenant ID | `e4ccbd32-...` |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_ENDPOINT` | OpenAI resource endpoint | `https://<name>.openai.azure.com/` |
| `AZURE_OPENAI_DEPLOYMENT` | Model deployment name | `gpt-5` |
| `MCP_PLATFORM_ENDPOINT` | Work IQ gateway | `https://agent365.svc.cloud.microsoft` |
| `OPS_TEAMS_CHANNEL_ID` | Teams channel for standup | `19:abc...@thread.v2` |
| `MANAGER_EMAIL` | Manager notification email | `admin@contoso.onmicrosoft.com` |
| `SCHEDULED_SECRET` | Auth token for scheduled API calls | `cassidy-sched-2026-ops` |
| `ORG_NAME` | Display organization name | `Contoso Corp` |
| `NODE_ENV` | Runtime environment | `production` |

### Memory Storage

By default, conversation history is held in-memory. For production:

1. **Configure Azure Table Storage**
   - Update connection strings in `memory/tableStorage.ts`
   - Creates tables: `ConversationMemory`, `UserProfiles`, `OrgGraph`

2. **Data Schema**
   - Partition keys: User ID, timestamp
   - Retention: Configurable (default: 90 days)

## API Endpoints

### Messaging
- `POST /api/messages` — Primary message endpoint (from Teams/channels)

### Scheduled Tasks
- `POST /api/scheduled` — Trigger daily standup or other scheduled operations
  - Header: `Authorization: Bearer <SCHEDULED_SECRET>`

### Health
- `GET /health` — Agent health/readiness status

## Usage Examples

### Start Cassidy in Teams
1. Add Cassidy app to your Teams workspace
2. @ mention Cassidy in any channel or 1:1 chat
3. Natural language requests:
   - "Break down the Q2 roadmap into sprints"
   - "Who's available for a meeting on Friday?"
   - "Summarize this week's project status"
   - "Escalate this request to finance approval"

### Scheduled Operations
Configure standup via Logic App (`cassidy/azure-function-trigger/standup-logic-app.json`):
- Runs daily at configured time
- Collects updates from team members
- Generates summary report
- Posts to ops channel
- Sends manager email digest

### Voice Queries
Call Cassidy's voice endpoint to:
- Report status updates
- Create new tasks
- Ask questions about schedules/deadlines

## Development

### Project Structure
- **src/** — Main agent implementation
- **publish/** — Azure App Service deployment assets
- **azure-function-trigger/** — Scheduled task orchestration
- **manifest/** — Teams app manifest and branding
- **skill-assets/** — Deployment scripts and templates

### Building
```bash
npm run build          # Compile TypeScript
npm run dev           # Watch mode (if supported)
npm test              # Run tests
npm run lint          # Code quality checks
```

### Testing
- Unit tests: `**/*.test.ts`
- Integration tests: Azure Function trigger verification
- E2E testing: Via Teams or Foundry test console

### Code Style
- TypeScript strict mode enabled
- ESLint configuration: [See tsconfig.json](cassidy/tsconfig.json)
- Format: Prettier (if configured)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**Error 13: AADSTS82001 "MCP app-only token blocked"**
- Cause: Using app-only credentials instead of delegated user token
- Fix: Ensure `TurnContext` is passed through tool setup

**Meeting transcriptions not processing**
- Check: `meetings/meetingMonitor.ts` event subscriptions
- Verify: Microsoft Graph `OnlineMeetingTranscript.Read.All` scope granted

**Scheduled API calls failing**
- Verify: `SCHEDULED_SECRET` environment variable matches Logic App trigger
- Check: Function trigger endpoint accessible and healthy

**Memory not persisting across restarts**
- Ensure: Table Storage connection strings configured in `.env`
- Create: Required tables before first run

## Security Considerations

- **Never commit** `a365.config.json` or `.env` files (protected in `.gitignore`)
- **Rotate secrets** regularly (MicrosoftAppPassword, SCHEDULED_SECRET)
- **Limit permissions** — Grant only required Microsoft Graph scopes
- **Monitor access** — Enable audit logging for governance workflows
- **Container security** — Base image updates and vulnerability scanning
